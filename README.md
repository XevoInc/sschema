# Sensor schemas
This repository contains code used for handling schemas for edge sensor data. It
is intended to be used as a shared codebase for sensor data schemas. By using
this repository, all software handling sensor data can agree on schema format
and simple things like representation of units.

When writing a schema for sensor data, any reusable or possibly duplicative
schema data should be put in this repository.
